            <h2>Overview of My Cloud and DevOps Journey</h2>
            <p> <pre> My journey into the world of Cloud Computing and DevOps has been a transformative experience, marked by hands-on projects, continuous learning, and a passion for automation. Starting with foundational concepts, I have steadily progressed to implementing real-world solutions that bridge the gap between development and operations.

I began by mastering containerization tools like Docker, where I developed a three-tier application and deployed Flask microservices in separate containers for frontend and backend services. Through this, I gained expertise in Docker images, containers, networks, volumes, and Docker Compose, solidifying my understanding of container-based architectures.

To deepen my knowledge of cloud platforms, I explored Infrastructure as Code (IaC) techniques, automating AWS resource provisioning and deployment processes. Using tools like Terraform and YAML, I successfully demonstrated end-to-end deployment pipelines, showcasing scalable, efficient, and repeatable infrastructure management.

Venturing into Kubernetes, I set up and configured clusters using MicroK8s, gaining proficiency in managing workloads, scaling applications, and optimizing resource utilization. These experiences have given me a solid foundation to tackle complex deployment scenarios in production environments.

Alongside technical skills, Iâ€™ve embraced continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) practices, ensuring rapid and reliable software delivery pipelines. My projects often integrate version control, testing, and deployment workflows, embodying the core principles of DevOps.

Through this journey, I have not only acquired technical expertise but also developed a problem-solving mindset that enables me to design innovative solutions. My work reflects a commitment to staying ahead in the dynamic field of Cloud and DevOps, with a focus on creating impactful, scalable, and efficient systems.

Key Highlights of My Journey:
<ul>
    <li>Proficient in Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms like AWS.</li>
    <li>Demonstrated expertise in IaC with automated deployment pipelines.</li>
    <li>Hands-on experience in microservices architecture and CI/CD pipelines.</li>
    <li></li>Passion for learning and sharing knowledge through projects and blogs.</li>
</ul>
I aim to continue this journey by exploring advanced topics, contributing to open-source projects, and delivering scalable solutions that empower teams and organizations to succeed in the cloud-native era.
